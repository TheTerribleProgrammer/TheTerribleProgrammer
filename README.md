- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheTerribleProgrammer
- 👀 I’m interested AI Dev.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything. Google guide me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much. I was just told I should have one of these.
- 📫 How to reach me - through telepathic powers, or simply find me online on TF2. 

<!---
TheTerribleProgrammer/TheTerribleProgrammer is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
I'm going to just add one tiny thing to this. 

I'm a terrible programmer. Don't collab with me unless you like your code looking like its been put through a meat grinder. 
If it works, it's because of Google.
